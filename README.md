# Connect Four

The goal of this project was to create an enjoyable game like the one we all know and love. The AI is moderately challenging, but not advanced. At present, it will block you consistently, make the winning move consistently, and try to make moves which lead to multiple victories, prioritizing short-term victories. There is a chance it will make "mistakes" and pick a sub-optimal move, which makes it feel a bit more human.
